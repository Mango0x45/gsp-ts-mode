* GSP Major Mode

This package provides a Tree-Sitter powered major-mode for editing GSP
files.  GSP is a preprocessor for HTML to make web-development less
painful.  You can learn more about it [[https://git.thomasvoss.com/gsp][here]].

At the moment this package provides support for indentation and syntax
highlighting.  The level of syntax highlighting can be configured by
setting ~treesit-font-lock-level~, and the specific elements to highlight
can be configured by customizing ~treesit-font-lock-feature-list~.

Other user-customizable variables of note are ~gsp-ts-indent-offset~,
~gsp-ts-font-lock-rules~, and ~gsp-ts-ident-rules~.
